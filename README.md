## Introduction
This project was created while learning from Colt Steele's - [The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-python3-bootcamp/).

The intention behind this project was to ensure that the students of this program properly learned how to create an automated web crawler and scraper, while also implementing fundamentals from earlier on in the course.
